# Speller
The program loads a dictionary and a text file. Then it spell-checks the file against the dictionary, pointing out any misspellings. Written in C, trie data structure was chosen to implement the dictionary and all the used memory is freed in the end.

The assignment was to implement loading up the dictionary (dictionary.c file).
